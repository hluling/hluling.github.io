Hello, 2023. I am going to attend and present at two conferences.

1. At this year's Global Digital Humanities Symposium (March 13-15, 2023, virtual), I will be part of the team (with Dr. Synatra Smith and Dr. Portia Hopkins) to present a digital humanities project titled "500 Years of Black History in South Florida." We'll talk about how we created an ArcGIS StoryMap to document the black history in 4 FL counties near Miami. Based on our interdisciplinary collaboration on literature review, ethnography, and oral history, the StoryMap showcases a photo-narrative of key locations of black history and a detailed geographical representation of sociodemographics and residential patterns using the tract-level Census data. This work is partly supported by the CLIR fellowship microgrant.

2. I'm excited to attend this year's conference of International Communication Association in Toronto, Canada (May 25-29, 2023). My coauthor, Joanne Kuai, and I are going to present our work that compares the AI governance policies between China and the US (Division: Communication and Technology).
