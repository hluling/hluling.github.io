Applied learning in action: Are you interested in creating interactive data dashboards? Check out my lesson published in Programming Historian: This hands-on lesson shows how to create interactive web-based dashboards using Pythonâ€™s Dash library. Using two news media case studies, this lesson provides a practical guide for making digital humanities and social sciences research outputs more accessible and engaging. This lesson titled "Creating a Dashboard for Interactive Data Visualization with Dash in Python" is recently published in [*Programming Historian*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107716).
