Here is [my second blog post on my postdoctoral work.](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/news/2022-4/energy-social-science-data-curation-series-2) Check this out if you love R, Shiny, both, care about climate change's impact on hydropower, or if you're just having a beautiful lunch in front of a screen.

In this post, I talk about my collaboration with Ana CÃ¡ceres, a recent Ph.D. graduate at CMU (Engineering and Public Policy & Civil and Environmental Engineering, 2022), to create the interactive dashboard [RICCH (Risks and Impacts of Climate Change on Hydropower)](https://ricch.shinyapps.io/hydro-shiny/).

Ana's research project simulates the hydropower capacity at the power plant level in response to global climate model simulations of temperature and precipitation under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. After simulation, the results must be communicated effectively. An interactive dashboard is a great way to achieve this by making the results of the study more immediately visible and accessible to a broader audience.

Stay tuned for future posts, I have two more coming.
