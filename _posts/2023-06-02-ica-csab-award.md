It is such a huge honor to [receive the Outstanding Contribution to Communication Science Award from the ICA Communication Science and Biology interest group](https://twitter.com/ICA_CSaB/status/1663229518167908352?s=20)! Thank you again to my dissertation co-advisors Dr. Edward L. Fink and Dr. Deborah A. Cai, and to Dr. Sungeun Chung for nominating our paper ["Psychological discrepancy in message-induced belief change: Empirical evidence regarding four competing models" (Communication Monographs, 2022)"](https://doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2021.1973051)
