As part of my collaboration with Dr. Destenie Nock, we will:
- Present a poster at [the 3rd Internatioanl Conference on Energy Research and Social Science](https://www.elsevier.com/events/conferences/international-conference-on-energy-research-and-social-science/about), titled *Income-related inequality aversion in residential energy consumption* in Manchester, UK in this coming June.
- Talk about the method we use to elicit how the public values inequalities in residential energy consumption at the [2022 Annual Conference of the National Energy and Utility Affordability Coalition (NEUAC)](https://neuac.org/event/2022-annual-conference/).
