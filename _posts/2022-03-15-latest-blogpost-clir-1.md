As part of my postdoc work, I wrote [a blog post hosted on the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries' website.](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/news/2022-03/energy-social-science-data-curation-1) This is the first post in a four-part series that introduces my postdoc work as a CLIR postdoctoral fellow at CMU. In this post, I talk about how Iâ€™ve used a scholarly information database (Dimensions) to help the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation to more efficiently discover and track the research output of its faculty affiliates.
Stay tuned for future posts.
