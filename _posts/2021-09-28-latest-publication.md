A manuscript based on my dissertation has been accepted and published online by [*Communication Monographs* [2020 Impact Factor: 8.667]](https://doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2021.1973051), titled *Psychological discrepancy in message-induced belief change: Empirical evidence regarding four competing models*.

And, here is the abstract:<br>
Message discrepancy is the difference between the position of an advocated belief in a message and the position of a message receiver’s initial belief, and psychological discrepancy is how the message’s discrepancy is perceived by the receiver. The present study tests Fink et al.’s (1983) psychological discrepancy model plus three other models to determine whether psychological discrepancy affects the weight of a message, the scale value of the message, neither, or both. These models were tested in an experiment that manipulated psychological discrepancy with a 3 (high vs. moderate vs. low message scale value) x 3 (wide vs. moderate vs. narrow perspective) between-subjects design (*N* = 448). The original Fink et al. model was the most supported. These results help explain how psychological processes bring about belief change.
