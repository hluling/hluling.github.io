As part of my postdoc work, I wrote [a blogpost hosted on the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries' website.](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/news/2022-03/energy-social-science-data-curation-1) This is the first post in a four-part series that introduces my postdoc work as a CLIR postdoctoral fellow at CMU. Stay tuned for future posts.
