Luling is a **Council on Library and Information Resources ([CLIR](https://postdoc.clir.org/))** Postdoctoral Fellow of Data Curation for Energy Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He works at the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation and the CMU Libraries, where he develops data analysis and visualization tools, conducts research in energy justice, and promotes best practices of research data curation.

Luling's research examines different organizing principles in processes of change in various contexts. His dissertation [compared mathematical models of belief change using experimental methods.](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/U8WSSABF6ECSR3B8PS83/full?target=10.1080/03637751.2021.1973051) Another aspect of his research explores the relationship between disagreement and the temporal network in online political discussion. His work has appeared in reputable journals such as [*Communication Monographs*](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/U8WSSABF6ECSR3B8PS83/full?target=10.1080/03637751.2021.1973051) and [*Computers in Human Behavior*](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1f3Aw2f~UWIsSN). He obtained his Ph.D. in Media and Communication at Temple University.

At CMU, he's writing [a blog series on the data curation work during his postdoctoral fellowship](https://www.library.cmu.edu/site-search?search=luling+huang&submit=submit). He was a graduate research fellow at the Scholars Studio (formerly known as Digital Scholarship Center) at the Temple University library. During his time working at the Scholars Studio, he taught and [wrote about various methods in digital humanities and computational social sciences](https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/author/tuf15333/).

When he's not doing research or coding, he's busy deciphering Viktor Vaughn and digging those old Stretch & Bobbito tapes.
